## Accessibility Lab Answers

# Color
The clashing of dark colors chosen for the background as well as text made it hard to read the text.

# Semantic HTML  
By trying to tab through, it was difficult to navigate the website with only my keyboard.

# Images
To make the images accessible, I used an alt attribute within the img to create a description depicting the image.

# Audio Player
I used an href element to show a download to the mp3 if the users browser didn't support it.

# Show/Hide
I added the ability to tab to the button as well as a "keydown" listener to allow
the user to use the button by hitting Enter.

# Table
I simply created css attributes for the already named table elements to create a table that clearly displays the information.
